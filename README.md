# Trip Gas Cost 
**Work in progress**

I created this project because I wanted to learn the basics of web app deployment. <br>
I used Google Google Cloud Platform to deploy and host it. <br>
You can visit the website [here](https://gasprice-253111.appspot.com/). <br>
You can use this app to find out how much you're currently spending on gas or if you're planning ahead for a trip in another country. <br>
A key input here is the car, model, and year; as MPG differs.

### Libraries:
- scipy
- Flask
- beautifulsoup4
- gunicorn

### To be continued:
- Add a *dependent SELECT* between the car make and model.
- Change the distance parameter into an input text field instead of a select.
